# Ethereum Transaction Data Extractor

This project demonstrates how to extract input data from Ethereum transactions using Go. It connects to an Ethereum client, fetches transaction details by transaction hash, and converts the input data to a hexadecimal string.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine.
- An Ethereum client (like Infura or a local node) and an RPC URL.
- Creating an `.env` file similar to the example

## Installation

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Running

```bash
go run main
```
